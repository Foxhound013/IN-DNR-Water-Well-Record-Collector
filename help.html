    <h1>Welcome to the Creek Run Water Well Record Search Tool!</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>To use this program, first press the browse button to search for your data file. The program is expecting a specifically formatted excel file (xlsx). An example file can be downloaded below. Please enter your well IDs in column A and do not modify any other columns. Do not modify the header that says "Well ID" as this will prevent the program's execution.</p>
    <form method="get" action="./exampleInput.xlsx">
        <button type="submit">Download!</button>
     </form>
     <br>
     <p>Once you upload your data file, press the Collect Records button. Please be patient as this will take some time. Your progress will be displayed at the bottom of the window.</p>
